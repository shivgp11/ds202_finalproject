3. This data set covers jail by jail mortality rates across the U.S. The data contains information on 
 the death of 7571 inmates across 523 jails from 2008 to 2019. 
4. My plan was look at the states, race, age, and cause of death and to find a correlation between those fields. I want to run regression on the 
death rates as there appears to be a general increase in the mortality rates in prisons in the last decade. My questions would include how does
race, state, and age influence the cause of death and what correlations have we seen to mortality rate.
